Red Gpio: 15
Green Gpio: 13
Blue Gpio:  12
If you have a rgbw stripe check "Enable WW Channel"
WW Gpio:  14
WW Color Temp (Kelvin): 2000 //This depends on your leds but 2000 should be fine for warm white
If you have a rgbww stripe also check "Enable CW Channel"
CW Gpio:  4
CW Color Temp (Kelvin): 6000 //This depends on your leds but 6000 should be fine for cold white
Red is on GPIO15
Green is on GPIO13
Blue is on GPIO12
White 1 (W1) is on GPIO14 is WW
White 2 (W2) is on GPIO4  is CW
There are two on board LEDs, a red one on GPIO5 and a green on GPIO 1.
